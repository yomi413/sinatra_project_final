## Cars Collection

Welcome to my final Sinatra Project! This application allows users to take the following actions:

  1. Signup for a new account, log in and log out;
  2. Add/create individual car entries to be saved to a database;
  3. Read/retrieve a car, as well as a list of all cars entered to the database;
  4. Edit/update only entries made by the user; and
  5. Delete only entries made by the user.

  2. Run `bundle install`;
