# SINATRA FINAL PROJECT

## Cars Collection

Welcome to my final Sinatra Project. This application allows users to take the following actions:

  1. Signup for a new account, log in and log out;

  2. Add/create individual car entries to be saved to a database;

  3. Read/retrieve a car, as well as a list of all cars entered to the database;

  4. Edit/update only entries that they entered and saved to the database; and

  5. Delete only entries they entered and saved to the database.


## Run the Program

To use this app, please follow the following instructions:

  a. Clone this repository and save it locally;

  b. Run `bundle install`; and

  c. Run `shotgun` to start the server.
